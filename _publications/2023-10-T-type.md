This paper presents an extensive evaluation for a new type of the Lâ€“2L de-embedding method applied to on-chip de-embedding. We derive analytical formulas to discuss and verify the accuracy of the improved and extended method called the T-type L-2L de-embedding. The case study structure to apply the new method consists of a microstrip line combined with two left- and right-side pads. For the simulation of the structures, HFSS 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulator is used. The results show that the T-type L-2L exhibits better accuracy compared with the other on-wafer de-embedding methods for a device under test (DUT).
