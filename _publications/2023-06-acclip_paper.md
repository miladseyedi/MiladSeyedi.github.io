title: "2X-Thru De-Embedding Method Using Time Domain Impedance Response for S-Parameter Characterization of DUT in Broadband PCB"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This article introduces a unique application of the 2X-Thru de-embedding method, where it utilizes the impedance response of a structure—deviating from its conventional usage. The method is employed to mitigate the influence of Sub-Miniature version A (SMA) connectors in broadband printed circuit board (PCB) systems. For this purpose, two 50Ω microstrip lines are created on RO3003 laminates, accompanied by 1092-03A-6 edge-type 2.92mm female end launch connectors serving as error boxes on the designed transmission lines (test structures). To simulate these structures, the HFSS 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulator, renowned for its accuracy in real-world comparisons, is utilized. The method presents a sequential S-parameter model for the structure formed by the SMA connectors and the transmission lines. This enables discontinuous fixture S-parameter extraction up to 40 GHz. The precision of the method's extracted S-parameters is validated by comparing the obtained results from the microstrip line trace simulation with the outcomes of the de-embedding method applied to the test structures. The error between the de-embedded trace and the simulated one is minimal, measuring under 0.3 dB.'
