I'll be talking about De-embedding Techniques. De-embedding is a signal processing technique used in high-frequency and microwave engineering to remove the effects of measurement fixtures and cables from the measured data, allowing accurate characterization of device or component behavior. Common methodologies include through-reflect-line (TRL) and short-open-load-through (SOLT) calibration. In TRL, known transmission lines are used to calibrate the measurement system, while in SOLT, short circuits, open circuits, and matched loads are used for calibration. De-embedding helps extract the intrinsic properties of components or devices, critical for designing and simulating high-frequency circuits and systems.
