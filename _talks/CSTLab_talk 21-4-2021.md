I'll be talking about my heterogeneous integration. Heterogeneous integration in high-speed interconnect refers to the process of combining diverse components, materials, and technologies to enhance data transfer rates and efficiency in applications like data centers and telecommunications. It involves integrating various components with different characteristics, employing advanced interconnect technologies, optimizing packaging methods, managing thermal issues, and striving for miniaturization and power efficiency. Collaboration within the technology ecosystem is vital for successfully integrating these diverse elements. The goal is to create more powerful and energy-efficient systems by harnessing the strengths of different technologies while addressing manufacturing complexity and cost considerations.
