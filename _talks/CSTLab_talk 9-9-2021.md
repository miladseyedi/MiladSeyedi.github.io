I'll be talking about my progress in research, building up a mathematical platform using de-embedding for Signal Integrity in high-speed digitaling Flip-Chip interconnect communication. The University of Tehran and the University of Waterloo are collaborating on this project.

You may find a shortened version of my presentation slides [here](https://MiladSeyedi.github.io/files/2021_09_09_De_embedding_Techniques_for_Analyzing_Die_to_Die.pdf).
