I'll be talking about multi-channel de-embedding. Multi-channel de-embedding is a signal processing technique used in high-frequency and microwave engineering to remove the effects of measurement fixtures, cables, or interconnects from multiple channels of measured data simultaneously. This approach is especially useful when dealing with multi-port devices or systems where it's essential to understand the individual characteristics of each channel or port.
